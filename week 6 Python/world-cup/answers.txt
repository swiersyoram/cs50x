Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
At lower simulations the top 5 was pretty random.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 100k simulations the top 5 seemed to have been set, at 10k it varied a little sometimes
